These are just experiments I'm running to test different things
and to actually comment my code correctly, since old experiments
are hard to remember/understand at first glance.

Plus if anyone else ever reads these files, they'll be able to understand easier.

I do plan on adding these, or similar files to the Go tutorials I wish to do so I can 
help others in learning this fun language :)
